# MATH ODE SOLVER

This is a demo application. basically, not the actual app but it can
parse math in [latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) format and simplify it,
write json operation of it and maybe solve it _(if numeric solve is possible)_.

## Prerequisite

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

### clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shu-vro/math-display-demo.git
cd math-display-demo
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

### Run the app

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Important

This is not the final or official project. It's just a demo to show how to parse equations and get
simple solution.
